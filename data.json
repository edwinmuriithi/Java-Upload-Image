Agricultural accounts for 65% of the total export earnings in Kenya with horticulture being the largest agricultural sub-sector contributing about 33% of the Agricultural GDP and 38% of export earnings\nDespite this critical importance, farmers have increasingly faced a ban on their export produce due to non-compliance with maximum residue levels in the agrochemicals they use. Export markets continue to increase standards regulating chemical residue levels leading to the ban of commonly used pesticides or severe restriction of their use. This move has negatively affected export earnings.\nGatsby Africa (formerly through Kenya Markets Trust) organized a business luncheon at Mwea Guest House where about 80 input subsector stakeholders deliberated on “Effects of noncompliance with Maximum Residue Levels to the horticultural sub-sector in Kirinyaga County and Kenya as a whole”.
